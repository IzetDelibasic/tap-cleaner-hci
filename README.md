# TapCleaner - Human-Computer Interaction

TapCleaner is a waste management application initially developed during the GlobalSoft Hackathon 2024. The app aims to regulate waste in urban areas by allowing users to report overflowing containers and enabling administrators to monitor and manage container statuses effectively. The project was further developed and refined as part of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course at the university.

In the new version, we've added the ability for users to interact by sending queries and fixed bugs from the initial version to improve overall functionality and user experience.
